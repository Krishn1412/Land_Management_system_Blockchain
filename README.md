Taks 3) implement pos
Task 4) Implement merkle root  (DONE)
Task 5) Some idea

we can create a property class and in that we can define a vector which will store its transactions

we will use the blocks only for storing the transactions and not the property which we intended to do.

create a class for buyer, seller, property and validator

create proof of stake using:
create a stake vector which will store that portion of land a person want to stake
from this set of people choose a validator
every turn 
pick a winner
take a bunch of transaction 
get it validated using a winner 
hash it and store it
then round two
